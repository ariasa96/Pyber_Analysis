# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The new analysis shows the fare difference between city types. With this information, one may be able to gather details on why fare prices may vary deopending on city type, which may be due to the number of drivers available per day or the number of rides available per day. One may conclude that with more drivers available, the average fare may be less due to PyBer being able to provide a high number of rides. On the other hand, if PyBer is not delivering a great number of rides due to driver shortage, then they may be required to charge a higher rate fare.  Also, the city type may play a factor i the fare rate.
##Results
Based on the images, we can see that Urban cities have the highest fare rate return from the three city types from January to April.
##Summary
Based on the results, three suggestions I would offer the company are
* If Rural cities fare rate per fare or driver was less, perhaps they would be receiving greater ride requests from the community since riders would be more inclined to seek for their service
* Hire more drivers for rural cities so that they could afford providing ride services for less money
* If they could not hire more drivers for rural cities, offer a promotion to the urban city drivers, which there is a lot, to offer their service to rural cities
